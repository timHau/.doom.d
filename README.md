# .doom.d
Just my private configuration for the awesome [Doom
Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/)

There is a lot of configuration just for my use cases so there might be quite a
lot not working as intended for you. I am using doom `develop` branch on macos.

# commands

``` shell
npm install -g --save typescript
npm i -g typescript-language-server
pip install 'python-language-server[all]'
```
